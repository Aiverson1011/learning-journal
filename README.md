# Welcome to my learning journal!

I am from Seattle Washington. I work as a lead instructor at Code Fellows. I get to travel around the world and hang out with cool people!

## What is a Learning Journal

A learning journal is a place that i can share my thoughts on all that i've learned this week. I want to keep track and share all the content that i've learned this week. This will be a good cheat sheet for me as i learn more about software development. 

## Growth Mindset
Growth mindset is all about determination. To me, growth mindset is never giving up and learning as much as i can from those around me. 

Here are some steps that I can accomplish with growth mindset:

1. Never give up
2. Read through my resources
3. Ask for help

I also can use these resources to assist me in my studies:
- Google
- Textbooks
- My instructors
